title: "AccelRSN"
summary: "Simuler les effets de l'accélération efficace de particules dans les restes de supernova."
#"Supernova remnants are thought to be the main producers of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. The blast wave can accelerate particles via the mechanism of diffusive shock acceleration. If acceleration is as efficient as is believed, it should affect the dynamics of the remnant itself. Multiwavelength observations can reveal the interplay between particles and shocks. "
