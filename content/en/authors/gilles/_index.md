Hello, I am Gilles Ferrand /ʒil feʁɑ̃/, a French and Canadian astrophysicist.<br>
My research started with the study of particle acceleration by shock waves in supernova remnants and superbubbles, to understand the origin of cosmic-rays in the Galaxy. My work is mostly based on numerical simulations, that allow us to model the complex multi-scale physics, and to predict the multi-wavelength emission. I have performed the first three-dimensional simulations of the evolution and emission of young supernova remnants including both hydrodynamic instabilities and efficient particle acceleration. To help making comparisons with observations, I have also initiated and maintained the first catalogue of high-energy (X and gamma rays) observations of all known Galactic remnants. Recently I have been working on making the link between the modeling of supernova explosions and the modeling of supernova remnants. I have shown how the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf can be imprinted on the morphology of the young remnant.<br>
I have also a keen interest in scientific visualization. I have been exploring techniques for immersive visualization of 3D data cubes, with applications to data from both simulations and observations.<br>
